## Experimental 

This directory serves as a home for experimental APIs, which may or may not graduate into the public 
`include` directory. 

Headers in this directory may be added or removed at any time, and are not guaranteed to follow 
any semantic versioning constraints. 

This means breaking changes may occur within any release.
**Use at your own risk.**

Once an experimental API proves to be valuable and stable, it may be promoted to the public `include` directory.
