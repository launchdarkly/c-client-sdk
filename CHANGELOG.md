# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly C SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [2.4.1] - 2022-01-25
### Fixed:
- Fixed build issue on MacOS Monterey 12.1 due to deprecation of a symbol.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-12-10
### Added:
- Added a new configuration for request timeouts. Use `LDConfigSetRequestTimeoutMillis` to set the timeout for non-streaming requests. The default timeout is 30 seconds. This includes the total time for the request including connection.
- Added a new method for configuring connection timeouts. `LDConfigSetConnectionTimeoutMillis`.

### Changed:
- Unit tests have been converted to use googletest.

### Fixed:
- Fixed an issue where inactive stream connections could remain open indefinitely. Now streams will be closed after 5 minutes of inactivity and the SDK will attempt to establish a new connection.

### Deprecated:
- Deprecated `LDConfigSetConnectionTimeoutMillies`. The `LDConfigSetConnectionTimeoutMillis` method should be used instead.

## [2.3.1] - 2021-07-09
### Fixed:
- Add more restrictive build flags and fix warnings


## [2.3.0] - 2021-01-26
### Added:
- Added the `LDClientAlias` function. This can be used to associate two user objects for analytics purposes with an `alias` event.
- Added the `LDConfigAutoAliasOptOut` function. This can be used to control the new behavior of `LDClientIdentify`. By passing true `LDClientIdentify` will not automatically generate `alias` events.

### Changed:
- The `LDClientIdentify` method will now automatically generate an alias event when switching from an anonymous to a known user. This event associates the two users for analytics purposes as they most likely represent a single person.

### Fixed:
- Relaxed internal locking to improve performance.


## [2.2.1] - 2021-01-12
### Fixed:
- Fixed the IP field of a user object leaking in certain situations
- Fixed the non allocating string variation not respecting result buffer limits
- Minor compiler warnings in MSVC

### Added:
- Added code coverage reporting to CMake
- Better unit test coverage

## [2.2.0] - 2020-11-24
### Added:
- LDBasicLoggerThreadSafeInitialize used to setup LDBasicLoggerThreadSafe
- LDBasicLoggerThreadSafe a thread safe alternative to LDBasicLogger
- LDBasicLoggerThreadSafeShutdown to cleanup LDBasicLoggerThreadSafe resources
- Tests utilizing a mock HTTP server

### Fixed:
- Resource cleanup on failed client initialization
- LDConfigSetConnectionTimeoutMillis configuration value being ignored

### Deprecated:
- Marked LDBasicLogger as deprecated


## [2.1.2] - 2020-11-17
### Changed:
- OSX artifacts are now generated with Xcode 9.4.1

### Fixed:
- Removed extra internal definition of LDi_statuscallback

## [2.1.1] - 2020-08-19

## [2.1.0] - 2020-07-28
### Added:
- Added `LDUserSetCountry`. Thanks @mstrater !

## [2.0.3] - 2020-07-06
### Changed:
- Windows artifacts are now released under both debug, and release configurations

### Fixed:
- Windows release artifacts no longer include miscellaneous build files introduced by 2.0.2


## [2.0.2] - 2020-07-02
### Changed:
- 2.0.0 Accidentally included the debug runtime on Windows. The debug runtime has been removed.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-06-18
### Changed:
- Update DLLs to include metadata on Windows

### Removed:
- Redundant internal logic related to stream cancellation

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-15
## Fixed
- The `LDJSONVariation`, and `LDJSONVariationDetail` variations now correctly handle empty objects, and arrays.
## Added
- A new JSON representation `struct LDJSON` and a large family of related functions.
- A dedicated C++ wrapper class `LDClientCPP`
- The `LDUserSetCustomAttributesJSON` function using `struct LDJSON` to replace `LDUserAddPrivateAttribute`
- A `LDLogLevel` enum for the new logging interface
- A basic logging function that can be used instead of writing your own `LDBasicLogger`
- The `LDConfigureGlobalLogger` used for configuring the logging function, and log level
- The `LDLogLevelToString` function which converts `LDLogLevel` to a string
## Changed
- Instead of `make` we now use `CMake` to build the SDK.
- The main include entrypoint is now `launchdarkly/api.h` instead of `ldapi.h`
- Previously the SDK defined either a class or struct depending on the language detected. Now there is a dedicated base C interface, and C++ wrapper.
- The types `LDClient`, `LDConfig`, and `LDUser` no longer use a typedef, and require the `struct` prefix.
- The `stdbool.h` header have been removed from the public API. All instances of `bool` have been replaced with `LDBoolean` which will contain a value of 0 or 1.
- Updated the `LDUserSetPrivateAttributes` function to accept `struct LDJSON`
- Updated the `LDAllFlags` function to return `struct LDJSON`
- Updated the `LDJSONVariation`, and `LDJSONVariationDetail` variations to use `struct LDJSON`
- The entire public API now has a "defensive mode" enabled by default, which is controlled by the `LAUNCHDARKLY_DEFENSIVE` compile time definition. This mode will check, and log detectable errors of API usage.
- Internal asserts can be controlled with the `LAUNCHDARKLY_USE_ASSERT` compile time definition.
## Removed
- All old types and functions related to logging
- The `LDNode*` family of functions
- The `LDNode` struct
- The `LDConfigAddPrivateAttribute`function
- The `LDUserSetCustomAttributesJSON` function
- The `LDUserAddPrivateAttribute` function
- The `LDClientGetLockedFlags` function
- The `LDClientUnlockFlags` function
- The `LD_store_*` family of functions

## [1.7.6] - 2020-04-01
### Fixed:
- Standardized streaming retry behavior. Previously exponential back-off was skipped.

## [1.7.5] - 2020-01-17
### Fixed:
- The SDK now specifies a uniquely identifiable request header when sending events to LaunchDarkly to ensure that events are only processed once, even if the SDK sends them two times due to a failed initial attempt.

## [1.7.4] - 2019-12-17
### Changed:
- Artifacts are now released as zip / tar files containing both binaries and headers. No SDK code changes associated with this version bump.

## [1.7.3] - 2019-12-16
### Fixed:
- Stopped using `clock_gettime` on OSX which is not supported for older OS versions.

## [1.7.2] - 2019-12-16
### Fixed:
- Updated cJSON dependency to 1.7.12 (to resolve several known security vulnerabilities)

## [1.7.1] - 2019-10-25
### Fixed
- Several race conditions in background threads causing lag when closing the client
- Increased validation of HTTP responses
- Simplified internal thread tracking logic
- Increased test coverage and documentation of variation methods

## [1.7.0] - 2019-09-26
### Added
- Added `LDClientTrackMetric` which is an extended version of `LDClientTrackData` but with an extra associated metric value.

## [1.6.0] - 2019-09-11
### Added
- Added the `LDConfigSetSSLCertificateAuthority` function. This can be used to specify an alternative certificate authority (such as your own private authority). (Thanks, Aditya Kulkarni!)

## [1.5.0] - 2019-07-26
### Added
- Added the `LDUserFree` function. This can be used to free a user object *before* it has been passed to the client
### Fixed
- A leak of HTTP headers set for requests to LaunchDarkly
- A leak of the in memory flag store when `LDClientIdentify` is called. This was introduced in `1.2.0`
- A leak of a structure when events are flushed but no events need to be sent

## [1.4.0] - 2019-07-03
### Added
- Added the `LDConfigSetVerifyPeer` configuration option. This option allows disabling certificate verification, which may be useful for testing, or in unfortunate networking configurations. Note that certificate verification should not be disabled unless it is essential, as it makes the SDK vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. (Thanks, [mstrater](https://github.com/mstrater)!)

## [1.3.2] - 2019-06-20
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where reconnecting in streaming mode sometimes erroneously waited for a timeout when switching users

## [1.3.1] - 2019-05-10
### Changed:
- Renamed the build artifacts. They are now prefixed with `ldclientapi`.
- Changed repository references to use the new URL.

There are no other changes in this release. Substituting the build artifacts from version 1.3.0 with the build artifacts from version 1.3.1 will not affect functionality.

## Note on future releases
The LaunchDarkly SDK repositories are being renamed for consistency. This repository is now `c-client-sdk` rather than `c-client`. (Note that `c-server-sdk` also exists, which is the _server-side_ C/C++ SDK.)

The library name will also change. In the 1.3.0 release, it is still `ldapi`; in all future releases, it will be `ldclientapi`.

## [1.3.0] - 2019-04-18
### Added:
- Version string macro `LD_SDK_VERSION` in `ldapi.h`

## [1.2.2] - 2019-04-16
### Fixed:
- Ensure `LDSetLogFunction` is properly exported in shared libraries

## [1.2.1] - 2019-04-12
### Fixed:
- Cleaned up exported symbols in shared libraries

## [1.2.0] - 2019-04-11
### Added:
- Added multiple environments support. It is now possible to evaluate flags in additional environments. You can add multiple secondary environments with `LDConfigAddSecondaryMobileKey`, and use an environment with `LDClientGetForMobileKey`.
- Added `LDNodeAppendHash`, and `LDNodeAppendArray`
- Exposed `LDConfigFree` (not needed in standard usage)
### Fixed:
- Switched to bitflag comparison routines as per cJSON doc
- Memory leak of background thread stack

## [1.1.1] - 2019-03-05
### Added:
- Improved Windows build documentation
- Added logging on authorization failure
### Fixed:
- Fixed a deadlock manifesting on Windows systems

## [1.1.0] - 2019-02-01
### Added:
- It is now possible to obtain information about how each feature flag value was determined (did the user match a target list or a rule, was the flag turned off, etc.). To do this, add `LDConfigSetUseEvaluationReasons(config, true)` to your configuration, and then call `LD____VariationDetail` instea of `LD____Variation` when evaluating a flag. The "Detail" functions will fill in an `LDVariationDetails` struct whose `reason` field is a JSON data structure. See [`DOCS.md`](DOCS.md) and the SDK reference guide on ["Evaluation reasons"](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/evaluation-reasons).

## [1.0.0] - 2019-01-10
Initial release.
